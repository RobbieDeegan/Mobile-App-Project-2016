My Ionic ToDo List for Android
==============================

This is a very simple app to add tasks to a ToDo List.
You enter a task in the text field in the add task tab.
The task will then be visable in the To Do list tab.

Thats all there is to it unfortunatly as I couldn't add any more functions like deleting, editing or saving without the whole program breaking on me.

I could only test the app on my old HTC running KitKat 4.4 but it is compiled for android MarshMallow 6 but I canâ€™t be certain if it works as my new phone will arrive after the deadline. Please contact me if there is any problems.
 
Thanks and enjoy
